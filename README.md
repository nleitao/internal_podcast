# NPod Podcast Feed Generator (v2)

## How to Use (v2)

1. **Add your MP3 files**
   - Place your `.mp3` files into any folder or subfolder inside the `public/` directory.
   - Organize by season, topic, or however you like (e.g., `public/season1/episode1.mp3`).

2. **Generate the RSS feed**
   - Run the Python script from the root folder:
     ```bash
     python3 generate_rss.py
     ```
   - This will create/update `feed.xml` in the root folder, listing all your podcast episodes.

3. **Publish**
   - Add and commit your changes, then push to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add new episode(s)"
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - E já está! (That's it!)

## About
